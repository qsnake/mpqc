   MPQC supports two input formats.  The primary input is an object
oriented format which gives users access to all of MPQC's options.  The
second format allows access to a subset of MPQC's capabilities, but is more
intuitive and easier to learn.  New users are advised to start with the
simplified format.  MPQC can be used to convert the simplified format to
the full object-oriented format with the <tt>-i</tt> option.

   Each of these input formats is described in the following two chapters:

<ul>

  <li> \ref mpqcoo
</ul>
