The sc-mkf77sym program is used to generate symbols for linking FORTRAN
subroutines into MPQC.

<h1>Synopsis</h1>

<pre>
sc-mkf77sym <i>input</i> <i>output</i>
</pre>

<h1>Description</h1>

sc-mkf77sym requires two arguments: the name of the input file and the name
of the output file.  The input file contains C preprocessor definitions of
the form '#define F77_FUNC' where FUNC is the name of a FORTRAN 77
function.  The output file assigns these definitions to the C symbol that
will link with the FORTRAN 77 function.  For example, if FORTRAN symbols
are formed from the routine name by converting to lowercase and have
appending an underscore, then the following input file:

\code
#define F77_DGEMM
\endcode

will result in the following ouput file:

\code
#define F77_DGEMM dgemm_
\endcode
